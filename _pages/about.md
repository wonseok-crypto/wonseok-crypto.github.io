Hi!

I am Wonseok Choi (최원석, 崔元碩), an assistant professor in the EECS department at DGIST, Korea. 

If you're interested in working with me as a PhD student or postdoc, please drop me an email.

I am working on multiple research topics, focusing on two main areas: 
1. security analysis/proof of algorithms and protocols and 

1. designing algorithms and protocols for multi-party computation, blockchain, etc.

More importantly, I aim to establish the precise security model or requirements for each problem, define appropriate notions, and conduct a thorough analysis.
Previously, I spent a great time as a postdoc at Purdue University and GeorgiaTech hosted by [Vassilis Zikas](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/vzikas/). Before that, I was a research fellow at KIAS (Korea Institute for Advanced Study) for half a year, mentored by [Changmin Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jTcNS8cAAAAJ&hl=en).

I received my Ph.D. from KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Jooyoung Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/cryptlab/home). During my Ph.D., I focused on provable security in symmetric-key cryptography: improving security analyses of several symmetric-key algorithms and proposing new constructions such as pseudorandom functions, message authentication codes, and authenticated encryptions with associated data.

Before studying cryptography, I majored in mathematics at KAIST for my master's and bachelor's degrees. I still enjoy solving math quizzes!


My research interests include 
------
1. Cryptography including symmetric-key, public-key, primitive design, and provable security

1. Secure multi-party computation and blockchain
   
1. Related topics in cryptology and mathematics
