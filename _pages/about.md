I am Wonseok Choi (최원석, 崔元碩), an assistant professor in the EECS department at DGIST, Korea. 

My research interests include cryptography (e.g., symmetric-key, public-key, MPC, quantum, and post-quantum) and related topics in cryptology and mathematics. I aim to establish precise security models or requirements for each problem, define appropriate notions, and conduct thorough analyses.

I was a postdoc at Purdue University and Georgia Tech, working with [Vassilis Zikas](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/vzikas/). Before that, I was a research fellow at KIAS, mentored by [Changmin Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jTcNS8cAAAAJ&hl=en).

I received my Ph.D. from KAIST, where I was advised by [Jooyoung Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/cryptlab/home). During my Ph.D., I focused on provable security in symmetric-key cryptography. My thesis was titled "Study on Building Pseudorandom Functions from Cryptographic Primitives."


I am currently running the Cryptology and Information Security Lab at DGIST. Our research focuses on:

1. Security analysis and formal proofs of algorithms and protocols; and

1. Designing algorithms and protocols for multi-party computation, blockchain, and related areas.

Previously, I spent a great time as a postdoc at Purdue University and Georgia Tech hosted by [Vassilis Zikas](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/vzikas/). Before that, I was a research fellow at KIAS for half a year, mentored by [Changmin Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jTcNS8cAAAAJ&hl=en).

I received my Ph.D. from KAIST, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Jooyoung Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/cryptlab/home). During my Ph.D., I focused on provable security in symmetric-key cryptography: improving security analyses of several symmetric-key algorithms and proposing new constructions such as pseudorandom functions, message authentication codes, and authenticated encryptions with associated data.

Before studying cryptography, I majored in mathematics at KAIST for my master's and bachelor's degrees. I still enjoy solving math quizzes!
